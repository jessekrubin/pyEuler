Cyclical figurate numbers
Problem 61
Triangle, square, pentagonal, hexagonal, heptagonal, and octagonal numbers are
all figurate (polygonal) numbers and are generated by the following formulae:

Triangle
P3,n=n(n+1)/2
1, 3, 6, 10, 15, ...

Square
P4,n=n2
1, 4, 9, 16, 25, ...

Pentagonal
P5,n=n(3n−1)/2
1, 5, 12, 22, 35, ...

Hexagonal
P6,n=n(2n−1)
1, 6, 15, 28, 45, ...

Heptagonal
P7,n=n(5n−3)/2
1, 7, 18, 34, 55, ...

Octagonal
P8,n=n(3n−2)
1, 8, 21, 40, 65, ...

The ordered set of three 4-digit numbers: 8128, 2882, 8281, has three
interesting properties.

The set is cyclic, in that the last two digits of each number is the first two
digits of the next number (including the last number with the first). Each
polygonal type: triangle (P3,127=8128), square (P4,91=8281), and pentagonal
(P5,44=2882), is represented by a different number in the set. This is the
only set of 4-digit numbers with this property. Find the sum of the only
ordered set of six cyclic 4-digit numbers for which each polygonal type:
triangle, square, pentagonal, hexagonal, heptagonal, and octagonal,
is represented by a different number in the set.
