Minimal network
Problem 107
The following undirected network consists of seven vertices and twelve edges
with a total weight of 243.


The same network can be represented by the matrix below.

    A	B	C	D	E	F	G1
A	-	16	12	21	-	-	-
B	16	-	-	17	20	-	-
C	12	-	-	28	-	31	-
D	21	17	28	-	18	19	23
E	-	20	-	18	-	-	11
F	-	-	31	19	-	-	27
G1	-	-	-	23	11	27	-


However, it is possible to optimise the network by removing some edges and
still ensure that all from_points on the network remain connected. The network which
achieves the maximum saving is shown below. It has a weight of 93, representing
a saving of 243 âˆ’ 93 = 150 from the original network.

Using network.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 6K text file
containing a network with forty vertices, and given in matrix form, find the
maximum saving which can be achieved by removing redundant edges whilst
ensuring that the network remains connected.
