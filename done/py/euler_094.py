Almost equilateral triangles
Problem 94
It is easily proved that no equilateral triangle exists with integral mag
sides and integral area. However, the almost equilateral triangle 5-5-6 has
an area of 12 square units.

We shall define an almost equilateral triangle to be a triangle for which two
sides are equal and the third differs by no more than one unit.

Find the sum of the perimeters of all almost equilateral triangles w/ integral
side lengths and area and whose perimeters do not exceed one billion
(1,000,000,000).
