Digit factorial chains
Problem 74 
The number 145 is well known for the property that the sum of the factorial of
its digits is equal to 145:

1! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 24 + 120 = 145

Perhaps less well known is 169, in that it produces the longest chain of
numbers that link back to 169; it turns out that there are only three such
loops that exist:

169 >>> 363601 >>> 1454 >>> 169
871 >>> 45361 >>> 871
872 >>> 45362 >>> 872

It is not difficult to prove that EVERY starting number will eventually get
stuck in a loop. For example,

69 >>> 363600 >>> 1454 >>> 169 >>> 363601 (>>> 1454)
78 >>> 45360 >>> 871 >>> 45361 (>>> 871)
540 >>> 145 (>>> 145)

Starting with 69 produces a chain of five non-repeating terms, but the longest
non-repeating chain with a starting number below one million is sixty terms.

How many chains, with a starting number below one million, contain exactly
sixty non-repeating terms?
