Quadratic primes
Problem 27 

The incredible formula n^2−79n+1601 was discovered, which produces
80 primes for the consecutive values 0≤n≤790≤n≤79. The product of the
coefficients, −79 and 1601, is −126479.

Considering quadratics of the form:

n2+an+b, where |a|<1000 and |b|≤1000 where |n| is the modulus/absolute value
of n (e.g. |11|=11 and |−4|=4). Find the product of the coefficients, a and b,
for the quadratic expression that produces the maximum number of primes for
consecutive values of n, starting with n=0.
