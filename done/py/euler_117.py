Red, green, and blue tiles
Problem 117
Using a combination of black square tiles and oblong tiles chosen from: red
tiles measuring two units, green tiles measuring three units, and blue tiles
measuring four units, it is possible to tile a row measuring five units in
length in exactly fifteen different ways.

How many ways can a row measuring fifty units in length be tiled?

NOTE: This is related to Problem 116.
