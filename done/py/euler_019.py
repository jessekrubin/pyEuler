Counting Sundays
Problem 19 
You are given the following information, but you may prefer to do some research
for yourself.

1 Jan 1900 was a Monday.
Thirty days has September,
April, June and November.
All the rest have thirty-one,
Saving February alone,
Which has twenty-eight, rain or shine.
And on leap years, twenty-nine.
A leap year occurs on any year evenly divisible by 4, but not on a century
unless it is divisible by 400.

How many Sundays fell on the first of the month during the twentieth century
(1 Jan 1901 to 31 Dec 2000)?
