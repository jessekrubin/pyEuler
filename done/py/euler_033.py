Digit cancelling fractions_in_range
Problem 33

The fraction 49/98 is a curious fraction, as an inexperienced mathematician
in attempting to simplify it may incorrectly believe that 49/98 = 4/8,
which is correct, is obtained by cancelling the 9s.

We shall consider fractions_in_range like, 30/50 = 3/5, to be trivial examples.

There are exactly four non-trivial examples of this type of fraction, less
than one in value, and containing two digits in the numerator and denominator.

If the product of these four fractions_in_range is given in its lowest common
terms, find the value of the denominator.
