Bouncy numbers
Problem 112
Working from left-to-right if no digit is exceeded by the digit to its left it
is called an increasing number; for example, 134468.

Similarly if no digit is exceeded by the digit to its right it is called a
decreasing number; for example, 66420.

We shall call a positive integer that is neither increasing nor decreasing a
"is_bouncy" number; for example, 155349.

Clearly there cannot be any is_bouncy numbers below one-hundred, but just over
half of the numbers below one-thousand (525) are is_bouncy. In fact, the least
number for which the proportion of is_bouncy numbers first reaches 50% is 538.

Surprisingly, is_bouncy numbers become more and more common and by the time we
reach 21780 the proportion of is_bouncy numbers is equal to 90%.

Find the least number for which the proportion of bouncy numbers is exactly
99%
