Square digit chains
Problem 92
A number chain is created by continuously adding the square of the digits in a 
number to form a new number until it has been seen before.

For example,

44 → 32 → 13 → 10 → 1 → 1
85 → 89 → 145 → 42 → 20 → 4 → 16 → 37 → 58 → 89

Therefore any chain that arrives at 1 or 89 will become stuck in an endless 
loop. What is most amazing is that EVERY starting number will eventually arrive
at 1 or 89.

How many starting numbers below ten million will arrive at 89?
