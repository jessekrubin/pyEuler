Digit power sum
Problem 119
The number 512 is interesting because it is equal to the sum of its digits
raised to some power: 5 + 1 + 2 = 8, and 8**3 = 512. Another example of a
number with this property is 614656 = 284.

We shall define an to be the nth term of this sequence and insist that a
number must contain at least two digits to have a sum.

You are given that a2 = 512 and a10 = 614656.

Find a30.
