"""
Singular integer right triangles
Problem 75
It turns out that 12 cm is the smallest mag of wire that can be bent to
form an integer sided right angle triangle in exactly one way, but there are
many more examples.

12 cm: (3,4,5)
24 cm: (6,8,10)
30 cm: (5,12,13)
36 cm: (9,12,15)
40 cm: (8,15,17)
48 cm: (12,16,20)

In contrast, some lengths of wire, like 20 cm, cannot be bent to form an
integer sided right angle triangle, and other lengths allow more than one
solution to be found; for example, using 120 cm it is possible to form
exactly three different integer sided right angle triangles.

120 cm: (30,40,50), (20,48,52), (24,45,51)

Given that L is the mag of the wire, for how many values of
L â‰¤ 1,500,000 can exactly one integer sided right angle triangle
be formed?
