Crack-free Walls
Problem 215
Consider the problem of building a wall out of 2×1 and 3×1 bricks
(horizontal×vertical dimensions) such that, for extra strength, the gaps
between horizontally-adjacent bricks never line up in consecutive layers,
i.e. never form a "running crack".

For example, the following 9×3 wall is not acceptable due to the running crack
shown in red:

|# # #|# #|# #|# #|
|# #|# # #|# #|# #|
|# # #|# # #|# # #|

There are eight ways of forming a crack-free 9×3 wall, written W(9,3) = 8.

Calculate W(32,10).
