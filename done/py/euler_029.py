Consider all integer combinations of ab for 2 ≤ a ≤ 5 and 2 ≤ b ≤ 5:

22 = 4, 23 = 8, 24 = 16, 25 = 32
32 = 9, 33 = 27, 34 = 81, 35 = 243
42 = 16, 43 = 64, 44 = 256, 45 = 1024
52 = 25, 53 = 125, 54 = 625, 55 = 3125

If they are then placed in numerical order, with any repeats removed, we get
the following sequence of 15 distinct terms:

4, 8, 9, 16, 25, 27, 32, 64, 81, 125, 243, 256, 625, 1024, 3125

How many distinct terms are in the sequence generated by ab for 2 ≤ a ≤ 100
and 2 ≤ b ≤ 100?
