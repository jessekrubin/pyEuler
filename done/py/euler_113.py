Non-is_bouncy numbers
Problem 113
Working from left-to-right if no digit is exceeded by the digit to its left it
is called an increasing number; for example, 134468.

Similarly if no digit is exceeded by the digit to its right it is called a
decreasing number; for example, 66420.

We shall call a positive integer that is neither increasing nor decreasing a
"bouncy" number; for example, 155349.

As n increases, the proportion of bouncy numbers below n increases such that
there are only 12951 numbers below one-million that are not bouncy and only
277032 non-bouncy numbers below 10**10.

How many numbers below a googol (10**100) are not bouncy?
