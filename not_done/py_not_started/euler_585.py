Nested square roots
http://projecteuler.net/problem=585
Consider the term √(x+√(y)+√(z)) that is representing a nested square root. x, y and z are positive integers and y and z are not allowed to be perfect squares, so the number below the outer square root is irrational. Still it can be shown that for some combinations of x, y and z the given term can be simplified into a sum and/or difference of simple square roots of integers, actually denesting the square roots in the initial expression.
Here are some examples of this denesting:
√(3+√(2)+√(2))=√(2)+√(1)=√(2)+1
√(8+√(15)+√(15))=√(5)+√(3)
√(20+√(96)+√(12))=√(9)+√(6)+√(3)-√(2)=3+√(6)+√(3)-√(2)
√(28+√(160)+√(108))=√(15)+√(6)+√(5)-√(2)
As you can see the integers used in the denested expression may also be perfect squares resulting in further simplification.
Let F(n) be the number of different terms √(x+√(y)+√(z)), that can be denested into the sum and/or difference of a finite number of square roots, given the additional condition that 0<x < n. That is,
√(x+√(y)+√(z))=∑_i=1^k s_i√(a_i)
with k, x, y, z and all a_i being positive integers, all s_i =± 1 and x< n. Furthermore y and z  are not allowed to be perfect squares.
Nested roots with the same value are not considered different, for example √(7+√(3)+√(27)), √(7+√(12)+√(12)) and √(7+√(27)+√(3)), that can all three be denested into  2+√(3), would only be counted once.
You are given that F(10)=17, F(15)=46, F(20)=86, F(30)=213 and F(100)=2918 and F(5000)=11134074.
Find F(5000000).
