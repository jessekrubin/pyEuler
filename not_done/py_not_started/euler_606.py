Gozinta Chains II
http://projecteuler.net/problem=606
A gozinta chain for n is a sequence 1,a,b,...,n where each element properly divides the next.
For example, there are eight distinct gozinta chains for 12:
1,12, 1,2,12, 1,2,4,12, 1,2,6,12, 1,3,12, 1,3,6,12, 1,4,12 and 1,6,12.
Let S(n) be the sum of all numbers, k, not exceeding n, which have 252 distinct gozinta chains.
You are given S(106)=8462952 and S(1012)=623291998881978.
Find S(1036), giving the last nine digits of your answer.
