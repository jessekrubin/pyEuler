Counting primitive Pythagorean triples
http://projecteuler.net/problem=540
A Pythagorean triple consists of three positive integers a, b and c satisfying a^2+b^2=c^2.
The triple is called primitive if a, b and c are relatively prime.
Let P(n) be the number of primitive Pythagorean triples with a < b < c < n.
For example P(20) = 3, since there are three triples: (3,4,5), (5,12,13) and (8,15,17).
You are given that P(106) = 159139.
Find P(3141592653589793).
