Maximal perimeter
http://projecteuler.net/problem=562
Construct triangle ABC such that:
Vertices A, B and C are lattice points inside or on the circle of radius r centered at the origin;
the triangle contains no other lattice point inside or on its edges;
the perimeter is maximum.Let R be the circumradius of triangle ABC and T(r) = R/r.
For r = 5, one possible triangle has vertices (-4,-3), (4,2)  and (1,0) with perimeter √(13)+√(34)+√(89) and circumradius R = √(19669/2), so T(5) =√(19669/50).
You are given T(10)   97.26729 and T(100)   9157.64707.
Find T(107). Give your answer rounded to the nearest integer.
