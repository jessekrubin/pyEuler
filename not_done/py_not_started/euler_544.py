Chromatic Conundrum
http://projecteuler.net/problem=544
Let F(r,c,n) be the number of ways to color a rectangular grid with r rows and c columns using at most n colors such that no two adjacent cells share the same color. Cells that are diagonal to each other are not considered adjacent.
For example, F(2,2,3) = 18, F(2,2,20) = 130340, and F(3,4,6) = 102923670.
Let S(r,c,n) = ∑_k=1^n F(r,c,k).
For example, S(4,4,15) mod 109+7 = 325951319.
Find S(9,10,1112131415) mod 109+7.
